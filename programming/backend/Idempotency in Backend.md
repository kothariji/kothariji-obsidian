**(Resending the request without affecting backend)**

Idempotency is a property of API requests or operations that guarantees the same result will be produced when the operation is performed multiple times. This property is important in distributed systems and APIs because it helps maintain consistency and predictability in situations like network issues, request retries, and duplicated requests. Idempotency can also simplify error handling, concurrency management, debugging, and monitoring. 

###### Some HTTP methods are idempotent, including:

- GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE: These methods never change the resource state on the server. Browsers and Proxies treat GET as Idempotent
- PUT: This method is idempotent because the first request updates the resource, and the other requests overwrite the same resource state.
##### Solving for Idempotency in Backend

1. Generate Unique Keys:

	Create a unique key for each request, such as a UUID or a combination of user ID and timestamp. Ensure the key is unique to the particular request to avoid duplication.

2. Store Request in Cache:

	Use a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to store the unique key along with the request details and its response. Set an appropriate expiration time for the cache entries based on the application's needs.


3. Check Cache for Existing Key:

	Before processing a new request, check the cache to see if the unique key already exists.
	If the key exists, retrieve and return the stored response to ensure idempotency.

4. Process Request if Key Not Found:

	If the unique key is not found in the cache, proceed to process the request as usual.
	After processing, store the unique key and the response in the cache.

5. Handle Concurrent Requests:

	Implement locks or atomic operations to handle concurrent requests with the same unique key to avoid race conditions.
